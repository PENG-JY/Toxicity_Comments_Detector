# Data Files

The data used in this project is organized into several key stages:

1. **Raw Data**: This is the original dataset containing user-submitted comments, specifically related to AI art discussions. It includes both toxic and non-toxic comments, which serve as the basis for training and evaluating the models.

2. **Cleaned Data**: After preprocessing, the raw data is cleaned to remove noise, irrelevant information, and ensure consistency. The cleaned dataset is used for training the machine learning models, as it provides more reliable and structured data for model learning.

3. **Predicted Data**: After the model makes predictions, the results are stored in this file. It contains the original comments along with their corresponding toxicity scores (predicted by the models). This is the final output that can be used for further analysis or visualizations.
